The Drut Containers clusters are installed on the host machine. After the execution of the above 
command, a k8s_hosts  file is generated by default, which serves as an inventory for DFM and VRM 
installation or upgrade purposes.
Here is a sample of what the contents of a k8s_hosts  (on page 23)  file might look like:
# Ansible managed
[masters]
drut-1-kube-master1  ansible_host=10.51.10.41
drut-1-kube-master2  ansible_host=10.51.10.46
