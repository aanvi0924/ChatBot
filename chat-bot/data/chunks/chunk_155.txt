a. For each host, disable the compute service to ensure that no new instances are scheduled 
to it by executing the following command:
openstack compute service set <host> nova-compute --disable
b. To migrate live instances to another host, execute the following command:
openstack server list --all-projects --host <host>  -f value -c ID | while read 
 server; do
  openstack server migrate --live-migration $server
done
Verify that the migrations were successful.
