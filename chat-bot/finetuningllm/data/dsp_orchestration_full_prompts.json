  {
    "prompt": "What are the hardware and software prerequisites for installing DSP Orchestration?",
    "completion": "DSP Orchestration requires a bare metal server with Ubuntu 20.04 installed. The recommended hardware should support running DSP orchestration, DFM, Prometheus, Postgres, and Grafana on the same machine. For software, required dependencies include Python 3 and relevant Python virtual environment packages (python3-venv, python3-pip). The environment setup requires installing these packages and setting up the Python virtual environment named dsp_env."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "Are there any specific third-party or Drut hardware requirements?",
    "completion": "Drut provides specific hardware such as Photonic Resource Units (PRU 1000/2500), iFIC, tFIC, Photonic Fabric (PXC) along with Drut Fabric Manager, and Drut AI Workbench. The bare metal system should meet the recommended specifications to ensure seamless integration with these components. For detailed hardware specifics, Drut Technical Support should be contacted."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I properly set up the environment before installation?",
    "completion": "First, install Python 3 and its virtual environment related packages:\n\nsudo apt install python3 python3.8-venv python3-pip\n\nNext, change to the dsp/ directory, copy example YAML files to active YAML files, create and activate the Python virtual environment:\n\ncd dsp/\n\nfind ./vars -type f -name \"*.example\" -exec bash -c 'dest=\"./vars/$(basename \"$0\" .example)\"; [ ! -e \"$dest\" ] && cp \"$0\" \"$dest\"' {} \\;\n\nbash ./create_env.sh\n\nsource ~/dsp_env/bin/activate\n\nMake sure to activate the dsp_env environment every new shell session."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I edit the dsp-orc.yaml file, and what do variables like dsp_orc_snap_path, dsp_username, and dsp_password mean?",
    "completion": "In the ~dsp/vars/dsp-orc.yaml file, set these important variables:\n\ndsp_orc_snap_path: Absolute path to the DSP Orchestration snapshot tarball, e.g., /home/ubuntu/<package_name>/DSP-Ansible-<version>.tar.gz.\n\ndsp_username: Administrator username, default is drut. You may uncomment and change it.\n\ndsp_password: Administrator password, default is drut. You may uncomment and change it.\n\nThese variables configure the DSP orchestration installation and login credentials."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What parameters should I set in the dsp_config.yaml file for cloud orchestration?",
    "completion": "In vars/dsp_config.yaml:\n\ndsp_url: The URL (including port) where DSP Orchestration is accessible (e.g., https://<ip_address>:<port_no>).\n\ndsp_username and dsp_password: Default login credentials (usually drut).\n\ndsp_primary_network_space: The logical space grouping network subnets, typically \"public-api\".\n\nskip_allocation: Set to true to use existing machines; set false if creating new VMs dynamically.\n\nThis config controls cloud interaction and VM deployment behavior."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I define the dsp_primary_network_space in configurations?",
    "completion": "dsp_primary_network_space should reference a space created in DSP Orchestration that logically groups subnets to control machine network access and communication. Spaces correspond to named subnet groups like public-api. Define the spaces via DSP GUI under Manage > Subnets, then assign subnet spaces accordingly."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What does the skip_allocation parameter control, and how should I choose its value?",
    "completion": "skip_allocation: true means the system will use a machine already present and ready in DSP Orchestration (no new VM creation).\n\nskip_allocation: false instructs DSP to create new virtual machines from scratch.\n\nSelect based on whether you plan to run on existing hosts or want DSP to dynamically deploy new VMs."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What is the command to install the full DSP Orchestration and all required components?",
    "completion": "Navigate to ~/dsp/ folder and run:\n\nansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/setup_all.yaml -e @./vars/dsp-orc.yaml\n\nThis installs MaaS, PostgreSQL (MaaS and DFM databases), Redis, RabbitMQ (for DFM), NFS mounts, and TFTP servers, along with setting up login credentials."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How can I install only specific components like MaaS, PostgreSQL, or Redis?",
    "completion": "To install only specific packages or services, use targeted tags with the enable_maas_monitoring.yaml playbook. For example:\n\nTo enable only RabbitMQ:\n\nansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/enable_maas_monitoring.yaml -t rabbitmq\n\nTo enable Drut Postgres with DFM database, RabbitMQ, and Redis together:\n\nansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/enable_maas_monitoring.yaml -t rabbitmq,drut_postgres,redis\n\nThis selective installation helps tailor the deployment per requirements."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What does the option -t in ansible playbook commands mean?",
    "completion": "The -t option specifies Ansible tags to run specific subsets of tasks within a playbook. For instance, -t rabbitmq runs only tasks tagged as rabbitmq to install and configure RabbitMQ without running the full playbook."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How should I configure my network VLANs and assign IP addresses?",
    "completion": "Each network (e.g., PXE, Admin, Public, etc.) should be assigned a VLAN ID and subnet. Example VLAN assignments and subnet spaces are:\n\nPXE: VLAN ID 0, Subnet 192.168.0.0/24, Space Name pxe-space\nAdmin: VLAN ID 10, Subnet 192.168.10.0/24, Space Name admin-space\nPublic: VLAN ID 20, Subnet 192.168.20.0/24, Space Name public-space\n\nEnable DHCP on the required networks and create PXE subnets accordingly. Also, configure your ToR switch VLAN interfaces with static IPs using .1 address in each subnet (e.g., 192.168.10.1 for Admin VLAN)."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What DNS forwarder value should I use in the Connectivity group?",
    "completion": "Set the DNS forwarder value to 8.8.8.8 in the Connectivity group to facilitate domain resolution outside those managed by DSP Orchestration."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I work with external top-of-rack (TOR) switches that do not handle DHCP?",
    "completion": "If the TOR switch does not handle DHCP, you must manually assign static IP addresses for each VLAN within DSP Orchestration. For example, assign .2 IPs for each VLAN like 192.168.10.2 for the ADMIN network."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I generate an SSH key and upload it to DSP Orchestration?",
    "completion": "Run on DSP host:\n\nssh-keygen\n\nPress Enter twice to accept defaults.\n\nGet the public key:\n\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n\nIn DSP GUI, navigate to SSH Keys upload page and paste the public key to enable passwordless Ansible SSH connections."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I update the DSP Orchestration SSH key after installation?",
    "completion": "After installation, update the DSP Orchestration SSH key to match the SSH key of the Ansible host running the automation. This is necessary to allow seamless communication for orchestration tasks."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I access the DSP GUI and what are the default login credentials?",
    "completion": "The DSP GUI URL format:\n\nhttps://<x.x.x.x>:5443/DRUT/r\n\nwhere <x.x.x.x> is the IP of the host running DSP Orchestration.\n\nDefault username and password are both drut unless changed during configuration."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "What are the steps after the initial installation to complete configuration?",
    "completion": "After installation:\n\nLogin to DSP GUI.\n\nCreate logical network spaces grouping subnets under Manage > Subnets.\n\nCreate resource pools and tags to organize your hardware resources.\n\nCommission and configure servers and assign them to pools/tags.\n\nRegister KVM hosts for virtualization."
  },
  {
    "prompt": "How do I create logical network groupings (\"Spaces\") for subnets?",
    "completion": "In DSP GUI:\n\nGo to Manage > Subnets.\n\nClick Add > Space.\n\nEnter a name for the space (e.g., admin-space) then Save.\n\nAssign subnets to the newly created spaces to control network access."
